## Module Aims

This course aims to help [you] develop an in-depth appreciation of complete computer systems; encompassing hardware, operating systems and software, for advanced embedded applications. 

It aims to provide a practical working knowledge of the development processes involved in developing systems that span multiple layers of computer abstraction, allowing [you] to gain the experience of working on complex, multi-dimensional projects.

---

## Module Learning Outcomes 

On successful completion of this module a student will be able to:

[1] Design, and reflect critically on the design, of a complete system taking advantage of a broad computer architecture range.

[2] Critically research existing technologies across a wide range of subject areas to determine those most appropriate for a given problem domain.

[3] Demonstrate the ability to construct a complete system, using commercial off-the-shelf components, the can support the solution to a given problem.

[4] Demonstrate the ability to evaluate the performance of themselves and their team members while working in a team environment solving a complex problem

## Indicative Content

The content of this course will evolve along with the fast moving field of computer engineering. As an indication, at the outset, the course aims to take [you] through the application of commercial off-the-shelf intellectual property to develop custom, yet standardised, microprocessors on an off-the-shelf development board. 

On top of this development board an operating system will be installed to abstract the hardware from the software. On top of the operating system, [you] will be expected to develop specialist software.

## Teaching and Learning Activities

Concepts will be introduced in lectures. There is a strong emphasis on taught practical sessions to provide a combined theoretical and practical experience in analysis, design, implementation and testing within one of the specialist computer labs.
