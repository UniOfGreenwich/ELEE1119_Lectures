## Package Management Overview

<div style="font-size:26px">

- Unix systems are superior to Windows: Package Management.
- Can install almost anything with ease of from your terminal.
- Update to the latest version with one command.
  - No more download the latest installer nonsense!
- Various tools can be installed by installing a package.
    - A package contains the files and other instructions to setup a piece of software.
    - Many packages depend on each other.
    - High-level package managers download packages, figure out the dependencies for you, and deal with groups of packages.
    - Low-level managers unpack individual packages, run scripts,
and get the software installed correctly

</div>

<!-- Well that is my opinion -->

---

## Many different philosophies

<div style="font-size:26px">

- Monolithic binary packages: one big "app" with everything
bundled together
  - docker containers, most windows programs
- Small binary packages: separate common code into independently-installed "libraries"
  - MSI files, Ubuntu, most of linux
- Source-based packages: no installers at all! Compile all your programs
  - language-based package managers, brew, portage
- Benefits to all approaches
  - monolithic binary: fastish install, very independent programs
  - small binary: very fast install, less wasted space
  - source-based: fastest code, smallest install, easy to use open-source

## Package Managers in the Wild

<div style="font-size:26px">

- GNU/Linux:
  - Low-level: two general families of binary packages exist: `deb`, and `rpm`.
  - High-level package managers you are likely to encounter:
    - **Debian**/**Ubuntu**: `apt-get`, `apt`, `aptitude`.
    - **SUSE**/**OpenSUSE**: `zypper`.
    - **Fedora**: `dnf` (Fedora 22+) / `yum`.
    - **RHEL**/**CentOS**: `yum` (until they adopt `dnf`).
    - **Arch**: `pacman`
    - **Gentoo**: `Portage`, `emerge`
- **Mac OSX**:
    - Others exist, but the only one you should ever use is `brew`.
    - Don’t user others (e.g. `port`), they are outdated / EOSL.

## Using Package Managers

<div style="font-size:26px">

- Though the syntax for each package manager is different, the  concepts are all the same:
  - This lecture will focus on `apt`, `dnf`, `emerge`, and `brew`.
  - The `dnf` commands are almost entirely interchangeable with `yum`, by design.
  - Note that `brew` is a "special snowflake", more on this later.
- What does your package manager give you? The ability to
    - install new packages you do not have.
    - remove packages you have installed.
    - update installed packages.
    - update the lists to search for files / updates from.
    - view dependencies of a given package.
    - a whole lot more!!!

</div>

---

## A Note on update

<div style="font-size:26px">

- These "subcommands" are by category, not name: `update` is not always called `update`
- The `update` command has importantly different meanings in different package managers.
- Most do not default to system (read linux kernel) updates.
  - **Fedora** does; most others do not.
- It depends on your operating system, and package manager.
  - Know your operating system, and look up what the default behavior is.
- If your program needs a specific version of the linux kernel, you need to be very careful!
  - very, very few programs care about your kernel version.

</div>

---

## A Note on Names and their Meanings

<div style="font-size:26px">

- Package names sometimes specify architecture:
  - [`3456x`]`86` (e.g. `.i386` or `.i686` or `x86`): these are the **32-bit** packages.
  - `x86_64` or `amd64`: these are the **64-bit** packages.
  - `noarch`: these are independent of the architecture.
- Ubuntu / fedora often splits packages into smaller pieces:
  - The header files are usually called something like:
    - `deb`: usually `<package>-dev`
    - `rpm`: usually `<package>-devel`
  - The library you will need to link against:
    - If applicable, `lib<package>` or something similar.
  - The binaries (executables), often provided by just `<package>`.
  - Most relevant for `C` and `C++`, but also Python and others.
  - Use the `search` functionality of your package manager.

</div>

---

## Example Development Tool Installation
- To compile and link against `Xrandr` (X.Org X11 `libXrandr` runtime library) on **ubuntu**, you would have to install:
  - `libxrandr2`: the library.
  - `libxrandr-dev`: the header files.
  - Usually don’t explicitly include the architecture (e.g. `.x86_64`), it’s inferred
  - If you’re getting link errors, try installing explicit 32/64-bit version.
    - just google your error
- Splitting devel files more common for binary package managers, less for source-based ones.

# System Specific Package Managers

</div>

---

## RHEL / Fedora Package Managers (yum and dnf)

<div style="font-size:26px">

- Installing and uninstalling:
  - Install a package:
    - `dnf` `install` `<pkg1>` `<pkg2>` ... `<pkgN>`
  - Remove a package: 
    - `dnf` `remove` `<pkg1>` `<pkg2>` ... `<pkgN>`
  - Only **one** pkg required, but can specify many.
  - "Group" packages are available, but different command:
    - `dnf` `groupinstall` `'Package Group Name'`
- Updating components:
  - Update EVERYTHING: `dnf` `upgrade`.
  - `update` exists, but is essentially `upgrade`.
    - Specify a **package** name to only upgrade that package.
  - Updating repository lists: `dnf` `check-update`
- Searching for packages:
  - Same command: `dnf` `search` `<pkg>`

</div>

---

## Gentoo package manager (`portage` with `emerge`)

<div style="font-size:26px">

- Source-based package manager: compiles your packages
  - just runs a special **bash** script to compile
  - very, very fine-grained control over dependencies and features
  - use the latest software specialized to your hardware!
- **USE** flags control special "optional" features
  - would be separate packages on ubuntu
  - Want **java** or **emacs** integration? `USE="java emacs…"`
- Installing, uninstalling, and updating
  - `emerge` `<pkg>` to install
  - `emerge` `-v` `--depclean` to remove
    - explicitly checks to ensure other packages don’t need it first
  - `emerge` `-uND` `@world` to upgrade everything
    - flags are "update", "newuse" (if you turned on a feature), "deep"(also check dependencies for this stuff )

</div>

---

## Cautionary Tales
- **WARNING**: if you install package **Y**, which installs **X** as a dependency, and later remove **Y**
  - Sometimes **X** will be removed immediately!
  - Sometimes **X** will be removed during a cleanup operation later
- Solution?
  - Basically, **pay attention to your package manager**.
  - Install packages explicitly that you need
  - Check lists of packages when removing things
- Why does this happen at all?
  - Linux splits things into dependencies: avoids lots of extra copies
  - Side effect: dependencies are visible to you; you can use directly
  - In windows: dependencies are hidden

---

## Package Management is a core Philosophy
- Most of what makes a Linux distribution is its package manager
- Reflects Distribution’s philosophy
  - Ubuntu: "just work" and don’t think too hard
  - Fedora: "latest everything" but keep it stable+not too hard
  - Arch: I want to understand how my distro works.
  - Gentoo: I do understand how my distro works.

---

## If you’re thinking of installing Linux, by the way…

- **Ubuntu**
  - Benefits: easy install, out-of-the-box setup, common things "just work"
  - Drawbacks: too much magic; system "just work" scripts break if you need to do too many uncommon things and aren’t really careful

- **Fedora**
  - Benefits: still pretty easy to install, lots of good "get started
  quick" stuff. Good in a VM too
  - Drawbacks: a little less stable; can change deep system things
  but also not hard to break your system that way.

---

## If you’re thinking of installing Linux, by the way…
- **Arch**
  - Benefits: wealth of knowledge, really helps you understand why your system works and what makes it work
  - Drawbacks: limited automagic. Takes real time to set things up, or change important things.
- **Gentoo**
  - Benefits: similar to Arch, plus the source-based Portage package manager is pure gold. Great if you’re doing serious programming/systems work, or if you really need a thing from github that was released last week, or you have a limited environment. Great way to really learn Linux.
  - Drawbacks: absolutely no automagic. Takes real time to set things up, compiling is time-consuming, all the docs think you know what you’re doing.

## OSX Package Management: Install brew on your own

<div style="font-size:26px">

- Sitting in class right now with a Mac?
- **DON’T DO THIS IN CLASS**. You will want to make sure you do not have to interrupt the process.
- Make sure you have the "Command Line Tools" installed.
    - Visit http://brew.sh/
  - Copy-paste the given instructions in the terminal as a regular user (not root!).
- **VERY IMPORTANT**: READ WHAT THE OUTPUT IS!!!! It will tell you to do things, and you have to do them. Specifically
You should run '`brew doctor`' **BEFORE** you install anything.

</div>

---

## OSX Package Management (brew)

<div style="font-size:26px">

- Installing and uninstalling:
  - Install a formula:
    `brew` `install` `<fmla1>` `<fmla2>` ... `<fmla2>`
     Remove a formula:
    `brew` `uninstall` `<fmla1>` `<fmla2>` ... `<fmlaN>`
  - Only one `fmla` required, but can specify many.
  - "Group" packages have no meaning in brew.
- Updating components:
  - Update `brew`, all taps, and installed formulae listings. This does not update the actual software you have installed with `brew`, just the definitions: brew update.
  - Update just installed formulae: `brew` `upgrade`.
    - Specify a formula name to only upgrade that formula.
- Searching for packages:
  - Same command: brew search <formula>

</div>

---

## OSX: One of These Kids is Not Like the Others (Part I)

<div style="font-size:26px">

- Safe: confines itself (by default) in `/usr/local/Cellar`:
  - common feature of "non-system" package managers
  - No `sudo`, plays nicely with OSX (e.g. Applications, python3).
  - Non-linking by default. If a conflict is detected, it will tell you.
  - Really important to read what `brew` tells you!!!
- `brew` is modular. Additional repositories ("taps") available:
  - This concept exists for all package managers
- Common taps people use:
  - `brew tap homebrew/science`
    - Various "scientific computing" tools, e.g. opencv.
  - `brew tap caskroom/cask`
    - Install `.app` applications! Safe: installs in the "Cellar", symlinks to `~/Applications`, but now these update with brew all on their own when you brew update!
    - E.g. `brew cask install vlc`

</div>

---

## OSX: One of These Kids is Not Like the Others (Part II)
- `brew` installs **formulas**.
  - A `ruby` script that provides rules for where to download something from `/` how to compile it. Similar concept to portage’s bash files
- Sometimes the packager creates a "Bottle":
  - If a bottle for your version of OSX exists, you don’t have to compile locally.
  - The bottle just gets downloaded and then "poured".
- Otherwise, `brew` downloads the source and compiles locally.
- Though more time consuming, can be quite convenient!
  - `brew options opencv`
  - `brew install --with-cuda --c++11 opencv`
  - It really really really is magical. Just like USE flags in Gentoo!
  - `brew reinstall --with-missed-option formula`

---

## OSX: One of These Kids is Not Like the Others (Part III)
- Reiteration: pay attention to `brew` and what it says. Seriously.
- Example: after installing `opencv`, it will return:

```sh
==> Caveats
Python modules have been installed and Homebrews site-packages
is not in your Python sys.path, so you will not be able to
import the modules this formula installed. If you plan to
develop with these modules, please run:
mkdir -p /Users/sven/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
echo 'import site; site.addsitedir( \
"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages")' >> \
/Users/sven/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/homebrew.pth
```
- brew gives copy-paste format, above is just so you can read.
- I want to use `opencv` in `Python`, so I do what brew tells me.

---

## Language-specific package management
- Modern programming language environments have their own package managers
  - **Haskell**: `cabal`
  - **Ocaml**: `opam`
  - **Python**: `conda`/`pip`/`pip3`
  - **Ruby**: `bundler` / `gem`
  - **Rust**: `cargo`
- Works basically exactly like `brew`
  - separate, user-specific install directory
  - preferred to system packages but does not replace them
- Be careful when using these!
  - system packages are not preferred, but sometimes get used anyway
  - when languages rely on external packages, things get really hairy

---

## Other Managers

- There are so many package managers out there for different things, too many to list them all!:
  - **Ruby**: `gem`
  - **Anaconda Python**: `conda`
  - **Python**: `pip`
  - **Python**: `easy_install` (but really, just use `pip`)
  - **Python3**: `pip3`
  - **LaTeX**: `tlmgr` (uses the CTAN database)
    - Must install `TeX` from source to get `tlmgr`
  - **Perl**: `cpan`
  - **Sublime Text**: `Package Control`
  - Many many others…

## Some notes and warnings about Python package management.

<div style="font-size:26px">

- **Notes:**
  - If you want X in Python 2 and 3:
    - `pip install` **X** and `pip3 install` **X**
    - **OSX** Specifically: advise only using `brew` or **Anaconda Python**. The system Python can get really damaged if you modify it, you- are better off leaving it alone.
    - So even if you want to use `python2` on Mac, strongly encourage you to install it with `brew`.
- Warnings:
  - Don’t mix `easy_install` and `pip`. Choose one, stick with it.
    - But the internet told me if I want `pip` on Mac, I should `easy_install pip`
    - NO! Because this `pip` will modify your system `python`, USE BREW.
- Don’t mix `pip` with `conda`. If you have **Anaconda python**, just stick to using `conda`

</div>

---

## Concepts in language-specific (per-user) package management
- Packages do not require **root** to install
- Packages installed to per-user directory
  - normall a "dotfile" directory in your home
  - better-behaved things in `~/.local/share`
- need to change your environment variables to use correctly
  - usually at least `$PATH` and `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
  - sometimes also `$JAVA_HOME`, `$PYTHON_PATH`, etc
- can control selection of package managers with edits to `$PATH`
